Regression classification task: predict the number of collisions observed in a given day (i.e., the `collision` column in the data set) based on that weather readings of that day. This is important, because this model can enable law enforcement to be proactive in handling collisions."

The train error of the SVM model is 25.04 which is not a signficant difference from the test error, indicating not much overfitting. A high regularization parameter (C) acts against overfitting in this model."
